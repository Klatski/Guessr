# Guessr
Site is based on popular game "Guess Number"

It is my first site where i use JavaScript. I have learned JS for 3 days and still learn.
3 hour ago, I was just sitting on a chair and thinking about this game.
I knew that it will be hard but it didnt stop me
I have worked with this project for 3 hour and i have just finished it.
Of course, i ve used ai somtimes but only for learning without vibecoding.
Im happy for mslf
